# SFTP SERVER SAMPLE

This configuration should serve as a sample for configuring a SFTP server on DXP Cloud using IP allowlist.

Dockerfiles use popular images for each services, and contain minimal customizations to make it work.
LCP.json files also contain the minimum configuration needed for the service to work properly.
the sftp-server/users.conf file specify the list of users, their passwords their User IDs and Group IDs, in that order. 

This is not officially supported by Liferay Cloud.
